# Assignment Instructions
1. Build a long short-term memory (LSTM) model to predict the price of stock for Apple for the year 2021.
2. Use 75 epochs.
3. Visualize the results for the LSTM model.
4. Evaluate your model by determining the root mean squared error and explain your results (how accurate is your model, what could you do to make it better, etc.).
5. See if the model can predict 2022 prices.
6. Summarize the overall functioning of the RNN and its accuracy.
